This is a project that performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Big Mart sales dataset. The EDA consists of various data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, detecting outliers, and transforming categorical variables to numerical ones.It also includes using Machine Learning models to make predictions, based on the data.

  Problem statement
The data scientists at big mart have collecteed sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities.the aim is to build a predictive model and find the sales figures of each product at a particular store.
